# About
Various graphics demos and useful bits of code implemented in OpenGL. Intended for experiments and educational purposes.
Code is structured with an effort to make it easy to read and understand.

## Demos
* Complex object transform hierarchies (WIP). Features the `Transform` helper class, which simplifies manipulating object transformation, and a free look ("spectator") camera movement.
* Skybox rendering using fullscreen quad mesh (consisting of two triangles).
* To be continued...

## Dependencies
SDL, zlib, png, glew, glm. All sources are included, so there is no precompiled library linking and no pain
associated with it.
