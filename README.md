What works so far:
* Easy object/transform hierarchy management, useful things like `setLocalPosition()`, `lookAt()` etc.
* A thin layer of abstraction over Vulkan, changing all the time to suit the needs.
* Proof-of-concept texture loading from PNG/KTX.
* Skybox rendering on a screen quad.
* Offscreen rendering and a simple post-process effect.
